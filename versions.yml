# Version configuration for RTL8159 Driver QPKG
# This file controls all versions and GPL sources used during the build process

# Realtek driver version to download and compile
# This should match an actual release tag from:
# https://github.com/wget/realtek-r8152-linux/releases
driver_version: "2.20.1"

# QNAP GPL Kernel Source Configuration
# The GPL source is distributed as split archives that must be concatenated
# List the URLs in order - they will be downloaded and combined automatically
gpl_source:
  # QTS/QuTS hero 5.2.3 (kernel 5.10.60-qnap)
  kernel_version: "5.10.60"
  qts_version: "5.2.3"
  build_date: "20250218"

  # Split archive URLs (must be in correct order for concatenation)
  urls:
    - "https://master.dl.sourceforge.net/project/qosgpl/QNAP%20NAS%20GPL%20Source/QTS%205.2.3/QTS_Kernel_5.2.3.20250218.0.tar.gz?viasf=1"
    - "https://master.dl.sourceforge.net/project/qosgpl/QNAP%20NAS%20GPL%20Source/QTS%205.2.3/QTS_Kernel_5.2.3.20250218.1.tar.gz?viasf=1"

  # Alternative: Single archive (if QNAP provides non-split version)
  # urls:
  #   - "https://path/to/single/archive.tar.gz"

# Model-specific kernel configuration
# This is the subdirectory under GPL_QTS/kernel_cfg/ to use
target_model: "TS-X65U"

# Notes:
# - driver_version: Must match a valid Realtek release tag
# - gpl_source.urls: Can be 1 or more URLs - will be concatenated in order
# - target_model: Must match a directory in GPL_QTS/kernel_cfg/
# - qpkg_version: Derived from git tag (e.g., release-5.55.1b1 -> 5.55.1b1)
#
# Example:
# - driver_version: 2.20.1 (actual Realtek driver)
# - gpl_source.kernel_version: 5.10.60 (QNAP kernel)
# - git tag: release-5.55.1b1
# - Result: QPKG contains driver 2.20.1, packaged as version 5.55.1b1
