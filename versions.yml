# Version configuration for RTL8159 Driver QPKG
# This file controls the versions used during the build process

# Realtek driver version to download and compile
# This should match an actual release tag from:
# https://github.com/wget/realtek-r8152-linux/releases
driver_version: "2.20.1"

# Target kernel version for compilation
# This should match the kernel version on your QNAP device
# Check with: uname -r
kernel_version: "5.10.60"

# Notes:
# - driver_version: Must match a valid Realtek release tag
# - kernel_version: Must match your QNAP kernel (check with uname -r)
# - qpkg_version: Derived from git tag (e.g., release-5.55.1b1 -> 5.55.1b1)
#                 QPKG version is independent of driver version
#                 It represents the package release version
#
# Example:
# - driver_version: 2.20.1 (actual Realtek driver)
# - git tag: release-5.55.1b1
# - Result: QPKG contains driver 2.20.1, packaged as version 5.55.1b1
